# GymFC

GymFC is a simulation environment for developing and testing flight control systems with a focus in attitude control. 
Intially GymFC was first introduced in the [manuscript]() "Reinforcement learning for UAV attitude control" in which the simulator was used to
synthesize neuro-flight attitude controllers that exceeded the performance of a traditional PID controller. 
Since the intial release of the project is has matured, and become more modular
to support a wide range of flight control system and aircraft.
Currently, GymFC is the primary method for developing controllers to be used in the worlds
first neural network based
flight control firmware [Neuroflight](https://wfk.io/neuroflight).

# Features

* Support for IMU and ESC sensors
* Aircraft agnostic - support for any type of aircraft just configure number of
  actuators and sensors.
* Digital twin independence - digital twin is developed external to GymFC
  allowing separate versioning.
* Google protobuf aircraft digital twin API for publishing control
  signals and subscribing to sensor data. 
* Flexible agent interface allowing controller development for any type of flight control systems.
* Compatible with OpenAI environments.
* Support for Gazebo 8, 9, and 11. Gazebo plugins are built dynamically depending on
  your installed version. 
* Configurable through JSON


# News

* March 2019 - GymFC v0.2.0 is released. 
The new GymFC version is a major rewrite with substantial architectural
change emphasizing core princiles such as ocntroller development for a specific aircraft.
GymFC is now essentially a generic flight control environment middleware between the aircraft digital twin and the agent interface. Users now are responsible for implementing the agent interface and the digital twin; which are both unique to the aircraft.
* December 2018 - Our GymFC manuscript is accepted to the journal ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems.
* November 2018 - Flight controller synthesized with GymFC achieves stable
  flight in [Neuroflight](https://github.com/wil3/neuroflight).
* September 2018 - GymFC v0.1.0 is released.
* April 2018 - Pre-print of our paper is published to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04154). 


# Installation 

Note, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS are the only OS currently supported. Please submit a PR for the
README.md if you are
able to get it working on another platform.   
1. Install [Gazebo 9](http://gazebosim.org/download) with `sudo
   apt-get install gazebo9.`. Then the dev package required for building the plugins, `sudo apt-get install libgazebo9-dev`.
2. (Optional) It is suggested to set up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). From the project root,
   `python3 -m venv env`. This will create an environment named `env` which
will be ignored by git. To enable the virtual environment, `source
env/bin/activate` and to deactivate, `deactivate`.  
2. From root directory of this project, `pip3 install .`
3. Confirm `SetupFile` in `gymfc.ini` is pointing to the correct location.

## Installation of Docker demo (tested on MacOS 10.14.3)
This repository includes an experimental docker build that demos the usage of GymFC. 
<p>
Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) and [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) on your system.
<p>
Build the docker image

```
docker build  -f Dockerfile-demo . -t gymfc:demo
```
This will take a while as it compiles mesa drivers, gazebo and dart. It is recommended to give Docker a large part of the host's resources.
<p>
All all incoming connections to xquartz:

```
xhost +
```

Run the image and to show the [solo digital twin](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc-digitaltwin-solo.git):
```
docker run -ti -e DISPLAY=hostip:0 gymfc:demo
```

Replace _hostip_ by the external ip of your system to allow gymfc to connect to your XQuartz server.


# Development 

If you plan to work with the GymFC source code you will want to install it in
development mode, `pip3 install -e .` from the root directory. You will also
need to build the plugin manually by running the script
`gymfc/envs/assets/gazebo/plugins/build_plugin.sh`. 


## Digital Twin 
For simplicity the GymFC environment takes as input the aircraft `model.sdf` which contains all properties for the
aircaft in a single location. The SDF delares all the visualizations, geometries and plugins for the aircraft.

### Directory Layout
GymFC expects your model to have the following Gazebo style directory structure: 
```
model_name/
  model.config
  model.sdf
  plugins/
    build/
```
where the `plugin` directory contains the  source for your plugins and the
`build` directory will contain the built binary plugins. GymFC will, at
runtime, add the build directory to the Gazebo plugin path.

If you are using external plugins (e.g.,[gymfc-aircraft-plugins](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc-aircraft-plugins) ) create soft links
to each .so file in the build directory.



### SDF

Each model.sdf **must** declare the `libAircraftConfigPlugin.so` plugin. 
This is a dummy plugin allowing us to set arbitrary configuration data.
An example configuration may look like this,

```xml
<plugin name="config" filename="libAircraftConfigPlugin.so">
    <!-- Define the total number of motors that shall be controlled -->
    <motorCount>4</motorCount>

    <!-- The center of thrust must be defined in order to attach the aircraft
model to the simulation. The offset will in relation to this specified link -->
    <centerOfThrust> 
        <link>battery</link>
        <offset>0 0 0.058</offset>
    </centerOfThrust>
    <!-- Specify all the sensors this aircraft supports. Valid sensor types 
are "imu, esc, and battery" -->
    <sensors>
      <sensor type="imu">
          <enable_angular_velocity>true</enable_angular_velocity>
          <enable_linear_acceleration>true</enable_linear_acceleration>
          <enable_orientation>true</enable_orientation>
      </sensor>
      <!--
      <sensor type="esc">
            <enable_angular_velocity>true</enable_angular_velocity>
            <enable_temperature>true</enable_temperature>
            <enable_current>true</enable_current>
      </sensor>
      <sensor type="battery">
          <enable_voltage>true</enable_voltage>
          <enable_current>true</enable_current>
      </sensor>
        -->
    </sensors>
</plugin>
```

### API
GymFC communicates with the aircraft through Google Protobuf messages. At a
minimum the aircraft must subscribe to motor commands and publish IMU messages

#### GymFC to Aircraft

*Topic* /aircraft/command/motor 
*Message Type* [MotorCommand.proto]()

#### Aircraft to GymFC

*Topic* /aircraft/sensor/imu 

*Message Type* Imu.proto


*Topic* /aircraft/sensor/esc 

*Message Type* EscSensor.proto
